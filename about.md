# About

# Why
I have opinions, and I also have some knowledge that I like to share out. Previously, I would share this with people n person over conversations, but I've also had people tell me that I should write a blog or have some other meium for sharing my knowledge. Also, I like the idea of sharing knowledge, and helping to bootstrap people not only into the security space but also just getting into working with computers in general. I'm passionate about the field and want to help out as much as possible. One of the beauties of computers and networking is the ability to share knowledge around. Some of the problem with this is sharing of misinformation, and I'm hoping that this can be another beacon of good/correct knowledge. Feel free to reach out if I make any factually inaccurate statements, but at the end of the day, opinions are simply that: opinions, and although my opinions might evolve over time, when I write them, that's about as close to how I'm feeling about a topic at a given moment.

# What
Basically, I'm going to write about a few various "categories" of topics here. Mainly, the topics will revolve around:

* ELI5 Computer
* Computer Networking
* Malware and Security
* Mental Health and Various Ranting

Okay, but what exactly do these topics mean?

## ELI5 Computer
This is going to be articles about how computers work in different ways. I would argue computers are some of the most complicated systems that humans have conceived at this point in time, so I'm hoping I can help break this down, because it took me wayy too long to get up to speed and confident with what I know about computers to be able to really understand the big picture. This will be things like "What is a webpage and how does my computer make that happen to me?" or "I keep seeing 1's and 0's when people talk about computers... what's the deal with that, I never see 1's and 0's when I look at my computer?".

## Computer Networking
This will be articles about how various protocols work in general, and in an undersstandable way. Maybe stipulate about how to mess with those, why things are the way they are, etc.

## Malware and Security
This will be about cool things I see malware do, or maybe cool ideas for how malware could work. Additionally, various security topics... writeups for CTF problems, maybe.

## Mental Health and Various Ranting
I've had my fair share of issues with mental health, and I'd like a place to share advice for others who might go through similar issues. Honestly though, this can probably be useful to people who don't have these types of issues! The ranting is just probably gonna happen, I might break out another category for this, but generally is just going to be me talking about various topics and my opinions on them.

# When
Whenever I feel like writing something, or whenever I get the time to write down the things I want to talk about. I don't plan on making any type of schedule for writing things.

Spencer Walden. 

I graduated from the University of Washington (UW) in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics with a focus in Information Assurance and CyberSecurity. While I was at UW, I was a undergraduate research assistant to the Computer Science and Engineering department's Networking lab, where I worked on a project called uProxy. My job on the project was to reverse engineer the protocol that WeChat—the popular Chinese texting app/social media platform—uses, so that we could use it as a communication channel. 

After that, I took an internship with a network security startup called Icebrg. While there, I worked to develop methods to detect different hacking groups and malware. As of this writing, I'm technically still at Icebrg as a full-time employee, but Icebrg was bought in July of 2018 by a networking company called Gigamon; so I'm now a part of the Gigamon Applied Threat Research (ATR) team!

I've always been fascinated by hacking and computers, and started on my path to electronic enlightment by joining a FIRST robotics team my senior year of high school (shoutout to team 2471, "team mean machine"). It was an amazing experience that really got me inducted to how to think programmatically about things. While at UW, I spent many hours with the UW Capture the Flag (CTF) team and the UW Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team. In spending time with those teams, I learned a lot about computers via osmosis; that is, hanging out with a lot of people who know a lot about computers.

In my free time, I love to travel, go to concerts, and play games with friends. Of course, I also enjoy nerding out with random computer-based projects too.

# Cool?
Cool.

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk t me about anything, I'm available on twitter (`@__masq__`) or email (`me[at]<whatever domain you're reading this on>`)
